    """
    Builds a generic Bayesian Network for project planning based on activity dependencies and durations.

    This function creates a `pgmpy.DiscreteBayesianNetwork` where each activity is represented by two nodes:
    - A 'D' node (e.g., 'D_A') for the discretized duration of the activity.
    - A 'T' node (e.g., 'T_A') for the discretized completion time of the activity.

    The network structure is defined by the project's precedence constraints. The completion time of an
    activity ('T_node') depends on its own duration ('D_node') and the completion times of all its
    predecessors ('T_predecessor').

    :param project_df: A DataFrame containing project data, including 'Code' and 'Predecessors' columns.
    :param discretization_params: A dictionary with discretized duration data for each activity.
                                  Each entry should contain 'labels' (the possible duration values) and
                                  'probs' (their corresponding probabilities).

    :return: A `pgmpy.DiscreteBayesianNetwork` model representing the project, with all CPDs defined.
